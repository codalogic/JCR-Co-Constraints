# Document version notes

Documents with `-revn` in the name (e.g. `-rev1` in
`draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints-00-rev1.txt`) are
draft iterations for a particular version of the draft.
So `draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints-00-rev1.txt` is a
draft iteration of `draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints-00.txt`.

For convenient editting, the latest draft is in the file
with the extension `.xml.txt`.  This is copied to a file with
extension `.xml` prior to running through `xml2rfc`.
